<!-- If the chapter contains many chapters we want to display that. For example a country
     may have state chapters, states have regionals, or a country chapter may just have
     regionals. Simplest case is to assume only countries and regions and break it down
     when needed after that. USA stands out as an exception... imagine that -->
